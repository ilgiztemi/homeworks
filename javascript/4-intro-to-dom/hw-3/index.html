    <!-- Create a webpage with an `h1` of "My Book List".
    Add a script tag to the bottom of the page, where all your JavaScript will go.
    Copy the array of books from the previous exercise.
    Iterate through the array of books. For each book, create a `p` element with the book title and author and append it to the page.
    **_Bonus:_** Use a `ul` and `li` to display the books.
    **_Bonus:_** add a property to each book with the URL of the book cover, and add an `img` element for each book on the page.
    **_Bonus:_** Change the style of the book depending on whether you have read it or not. -->
